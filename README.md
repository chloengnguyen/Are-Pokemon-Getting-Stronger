## Introduction
Pokemon is the most popular video game series worldwide. The game is famous for its simple yet amazing gaming mechanics. Today, there are more than different 800 Pokemon in the game, and all have different natures, skills, and abilities. Although new concepts are introduced in every game, the series has stayed true to its core concept for over 25 years and is mostly balanced among 18 "types" of pokemon. Some speculate that newer Pokemon are more powerful compared to the old ones, having higher average "stats". Players often consider the stats of the Pokemon as an important key to build a competitive team. 

There are 6 stats for each pokemon: **attack, defense, special attack, special defense, speed, HP**. Addition of these stats produces the base stat totoal (BST), which can be an indicator of a pokemon general strength.  

## Hypothesis 

* **Null Hypothesis** : Pokemons from older generations have the same base stats as those from newer generations.

* **Experiment Hypothesis**: Pokemon from older generations has lower base stats compared to those from newer generations.

## Data Exploration

## Result & Conclusion 


## Additional Questions/ Works:
* Do the introduction of Mega Evolution skew my data?  
    Mega Evolution are modification of older pokemon and they are introduced later in the series. These new pokemon share the same pokedex number (id) as their original version but have higher stats. 
* Are all stats changing at the same rate?

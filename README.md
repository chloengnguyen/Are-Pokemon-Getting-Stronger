![](/home/chloe/Downloads/800px-International_Pok√©mon_logo.svg.png) 

## Introduction
Pokemon is the most popular video game series worldwide. The game is famous for its simple yet amazing gaming mechanics. Today, there are more than different 800 Pokemon in the game, and all have different natures, skills, and abilities. Although new concepts are introduced in every game, the series has stayed true to its core concept for over 25 years and is mostly balanced among 18 "types" of pokemon. Some speculate that newer Pokemon are more powerful compared to the old ones, having higher average "stats". Players often consider the stats of the Pokemon as an important key to build a competitive team. 

There are 6 stats for each pokemon: **attack, defense, special attack, special defense, speed, HP**. Addition of these stats produces the base stat totoal (BST), which can be an indicator of a pokemon general strength.  

## Hypothesis 

* **Null Hypothesis** : Pokemons from old generations have the same base stats as those from newer generations.

* **Experiment Hypothesis**: Pokemon from old generations has lower base stats compared to those from newer generations.

## Additional Questions/ Works:
* Do the introduction of Mega Evolution skew my data?  
    Mega Evolution are modification of older pokemon and they are introduced later in the series. These new pokemon share the same pokedex number (id) as their original version but have higher stats. 
* Are all stats changing at the same rate?

# Capstone Proposal 2: ****Does location affect job satisfaction ?****
## Introduction

In addition to salary, job satisfaction is a major factor in deciding to take a job offer. One common factor people look at is location. I want to investigate if there is a significant difference in **job rating** based on the **location**. I acknowledge that the amount of rating per job will not be the same between small and big cities and so as a result small cities have less robust data. 
For the purpose of simplifying this process, I will select only these locations: Seattle, New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Atlanta, Austin, Denver, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Phoenix. 

## Hypothesis  
* **Null Hypothesis**: There is no significant difference in job rating between different cities.
* **Experiment Hypothesis**: There is a significant difference in job rating between different cities.
